# Comprehensive Sales Analysis & Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project showcases the power of **Microsoft Excel** as a robust Business Intelligence tool. I created an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of sales performance by cleaning, modeling, and visualizing a large dataset. The primary objective was to turn raw data into a dynamic and actionable tool for data-driven decision-making.

## Technical Methodology

I followed a structured data analysis workflow to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the final dashboard:

* **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Utilized **Power Query** to clean and prepare the raw data, handling inconsistencies and optimizing it for analysis.
* **Data Modeling**: Built a relational **Data Model** to link multiple tables (Facts & Dimensions) and ensure data accuracy.
* **Star Schema**: Implemented a **Star Schema** to design a structured and efficient model, which simplifies data querying and enhances performance.
* **Visualization**: Created an interactive dashboard using a combination of **PivotTables**, **Pivot Charts**, and **Slicers** to allow for dynamic filtering and exploration of key insights.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

The analysis helped me uncover critical business insights and performance indicators:

* **Total Sales Exceeded $62M**: The dashboard highlights the impressive overall sales performance.
* **Product Performance**: Only three product categories account for the majority of total sales, revealing a concentration of revenue drivers.
* **Sales Channel Analysis**: There is a balanced performance across the three main sales channels, while the "Door-to-Door" channel is identified as an area for improvement.
* **Geographical Dominance**: Four governorates—**Cairo**, **Giza**, **Delta**, and **Alexandria**—dominate the sales landscape, while other regions are relatively close in performance.
* **Seasonal Trends**: The dashboard clearly visualizes sales peaks in certain months, providing a key opportunity for future promotional and marketing campaigns.

## Dashboard Visualization

Below is a snapshot of the final interactive dashboard, demonstrating the project's visual output.
